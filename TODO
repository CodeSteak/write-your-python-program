- Correctly set current working dir. That is, if you hit the run button,
  the current working directory should be the directory of the module being run.
- Imports to modules in the same directory are marked as warnings in VSCode
- Correctly set module name. If you hit the run button, the name should be '__wypp__'
  Otherwise, it should be the module name.

# Next iteration
- Contracts checking
- Rename Mixed to Union and DefinedLater to ForwardRef
- Write records in the style of dataclasses, drop support for old-style records
- Require explict import of wypp: better interaction with tools
- use lowercase types list, tuple, dict etc. (requires python 3.9)
- make installable via pip (for those we do not use the extension)
